# RevShell-Automator
Simple C2 server written in python. Uses standard revshells (so you can use whatever shell from https://www.revshells.com/ you want). 
Supports automatisation via ./c2_config/commands file (you can type whatever commands you want there, they will be executed in every shell that connects there)
Theoretically can be used for automatisation of home tasks (you don't need to type a lot of commands manually, just simple revshell script.)
